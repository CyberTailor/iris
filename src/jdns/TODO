(nothing)

but, this stuff couldn't hurt:
  fields that need to be an explicit size should use int16_t, etc
  dns ttl is 32 bit but jdns ttl is 31 bit (32bit signed).  could overflow?
  support for other DNS record types (SOA, NSPTR)
  detect CNAME loops, rather than looping max times in order to fail
  don't follow CNAME for SRV (or so I'm told?)
